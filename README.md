** What is @AutoConfiguration?**

Introduced in Spring Boot 2.7 / 3.x.

It is a specialization of @Configuration, but used only for auto-configuration classes.

It helps Spring Boot identify and apply your configuration in the right phase of startup.

Works with the META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports file.
